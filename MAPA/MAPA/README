How to run the program so far.

1. Must have Mongodb installed AND running

2. Go here https://beta.developer.spotify.com/console/get-search-item/?q=Muse&type=track%2Cartist&market=US&limit=10&offset=5
and get a new token

3. On lines 26 and 48, replace the 'Authorization': Bearer token with the new token after the word 'Bearer'




Current Problems:

Will currently only return the first id in the collection, not the one associated with the artist desired.



Note: 
On lines 18 and 19 in the file, uncomment line 18 and comment out 19 if you want to accept an input artist's name. I just put this in to test out the program more easily without having to continuously put in an artist's name manually.
